# AUV_MACH

## Overview

This project aims to develop an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) using ROS2 Foxy as the underlying framework for real-time control and communication. The system integrates sensors, actuators, and controllers to autonomously navigate in an underwater environment. The AUV will perform tasks such as obstacle detection, path planning, and object recognition.

**Key features of this project include:**
- Sensor integration (IMU, depth sensor, cameras, sonar)
- Autonomous navigation and path planning
- Real-time data acquisition and processing
- Simulation and hardware-in-the-loop testing
- Communication using ROS2 middleware

**Objectives**
- Build a robust control system for the AUV.
- Implement autonomous behaviors such as path-following, obstacle avoidance, and station-keeping.
- Test and validate the AUVâ€™s performance in a simulated underwater environment and real-world conditions.
